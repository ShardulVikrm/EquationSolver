## Examples

### Linear Equation

```
Enter the coefficients of the equation ax+b=0: 2 5
>>> x=-2.500
```

### Quadratic Equation

```
Enter the coefficients of the equation ax^2+bx+c=0: 1 -3 2
>>> x=2.00,1.00
```

### System of Linear Equations

```
Enter the coefficients of the equation a1x+b1y+c1=0: 2 3 4
Enter the coefficients of the equation a2x+b2y+c2=0: 1 -1 -3
>>> x=1.000, y=-2.000
```
